<b><i>WHO I AM</i></b>
<br><br>

I am a graduate student of mathematics at the University of Nottingham, currently doing my MSc in Pure Mathematics. 

My main interests are algebraic geometry and a bit of number theory(still new to this). I used to be quite besotted with symplectic geometry but it looks like it was just a phase.


<b><i>MATHS I THINK ABOUT RIGHT NOW</i></b>
<br><br>
  Lately I think about deformations of schemes. There's lots of algebra behind it but also many interesting geometric questions to think about. It's a powerful tool that's very useful(apparently) for studying singularities and it's also a major ingreditent of mirror symmetry. Homological algebra still eludes me, but I'm making a slow and steady progress in that area as well. 
  
  
<b><i>WHAT I'M WRITING</i></b> 
<br><br>
Right now I'm focusing on personal statements and coursework. 


<b><i>WHAT I'M LISTENING TO</i></b> 
<br><br>
Lots of Finnish rap in my YouTube mix lately. 


<b><i>WHAT I'M READING ATM</i></b> 
<br><br>
FICTION: The Three Body Problem Trilogy by Cixin Liu. It's the best scifi book I ever read.
NON-FICTION: Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari
